The  repository contains sample code for the series of blog posts that I did comparing common .Net IoC containers.

http://www.anthonysteele.co.uk/comparing-.net-ioc-containers-part-zero-groundwork

For each tool that is reviewed, there is a file containing the tests on that container (e.g. tests on castle Windsor are in WindsorTest.cs). The code runs aach container through a simple set of standard scenarios creating variations on the same class hierarchy. 

This demo code may also be usefull if you know how to use container A but now want to use container B - you can compare code that does the same thing via containers A and B.

You are welcome to use this sample code for any purpose whatsoever, but no  guarantee of reliability, best practice or fitness for purpose is implied.
